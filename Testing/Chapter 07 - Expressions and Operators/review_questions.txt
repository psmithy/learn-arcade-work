2 - 1 = 1
2 * 2 = 4
2 / 2 = 1
5 // 2 = 2
2 ** 3 = 8
5 % 2 = 1


What is integer division? Explain.

Division where the resulting number is rounded down to an integer.

What is modulus?

The modulus provides the remainder from division.

Rewrite the expression v = 2(3.14r) so that it works in Python.

v = 2 * (3.14 * r)

What is the code to add 1 to x? (That is, actually change the value of x.)

x = x + 1

Show how to use the increment operator to add one to x.

x += 1

Give an example of printing a variable, including additional text that labels what it is.

r = 3

v = 2 * (3.14 * r)

print("v =", v)
